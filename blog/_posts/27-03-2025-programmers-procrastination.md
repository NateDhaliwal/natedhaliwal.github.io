## Procrastination
Procrastination. We've all been there, I'm sure. It is a common thing, whether our project is big or small, we are always putting something off.

Let's say we have a huge project that we are in the middle off. You take a look at your to-do list, you see 20 things on it, and think: ugh, I don't want to do it now. I'll do it later. This is the very thing that we shouldn't do! When we procrastinate, we put it away, but it's still there! It's not like you can just `rm -rf` it away! See, when we procrastinate, we get more lazy. Yes, because we decide not to do it, tell ourselves that we'll do it tomorrow, and this is an endless cycle. Only when we realise that the deadline is reaching inexorably closer, do we take action and get down to it. Things are rushed, maybe sloppy, and generally not of a high standard, unless you really work late into the night with many cups of coffee.

## So what can we do about it?
1. Timetables. Classic, textbook answer, you say, but it is helpful! We plan what we do on what day. If you very meticulous, you may want to plan it day by day as well, so you can go into the finer details of what you wish to achieve that day.
2. Get right down to it. Don't procrastinate- the moment you receive the task, go and start doing it. Have a momentum. Have a rhythm. Don't put things off, look at it positively. This brings us to our last point.
3. A positive mindset. C'mon, don't be a pessimist. Look at it in a positive angle. A glass filled with water to the half-way mark: half-full or half-empty? Kudos to you if you said half-full: you're positive! 'We're nearly done with the project!' is better than 'We still have so many things to do...'. Let's look on the side of how far we've come, instead of how much we have left. Still a long way to go? A positive person will affirm themself and make them go further. Positivity conquers procrastination: when we get motivated and encourage ourselves, we don't look at all the things that we have to do, but instead look at what we can build on top of what we have done.

## In summary...
I know that was quite long, so I'll make this quick. Let's not procrastinate in all things we do, whether it's a program, an assignment or anything else, we should always go on and not delay. Remember the 3 points I mentioned above ⬆️! They can _really_ help!

## Share you experience!

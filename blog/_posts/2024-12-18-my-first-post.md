I'm NateDhaliwal. I'm starting this blog today! Allow me to introduce myself.
<br><br>
I used to be an avid Replit user. [Replit](https://replit.com) is a cloud-based IDE. After shutting down Replit Ask (their support forum), I lost my interest with in and now code in CodeSandbox or local dev.
<br><br>
The Replit support forum was made using [Discourse](https://discourse.org), an amazing 100% open-source and free forum software. They are very popular, and have pretty big companies as their customers. You can [self-host your forum]() or host it with them (for a price). <br>
I love Discourse and am a huge fan, so I'm building customizations like Theme Components and Themes. I enjoy the challenge, and since their codename is <big>HUGE</big>, I learn something new everyday.
<br><br>
I am a Python full-stack web developer. I know Python, HTML, CSS and JS. I'm currently learning SQL, to help manage databases more effectively.
<br><br>
I hope to upkeep this blog to continue posting blog posts. Perhaps not like Jeff Atwood, with his incredibly popular blog, [codinghorror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), but at least to some degree ðŸ˜‰.

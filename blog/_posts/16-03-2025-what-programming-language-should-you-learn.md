Many people have this same question: what programming language should I start learning? There is no easy answer. It really depends on what you want to learn. In this post, I'll explore the different programming languages and the benefits they bring.

<hr />

1. Python. Python is the most common, yet general programming language. It can be used for machine learning, data science, web development, among other things. I would recommend learning this. You can learn all sorts of useful programming concepts, like algorithms or binary search.
2. JavaScript. Not Java, JavaScript (a.k.a. ECMAScript). JavaScript (or JS) is used for web development. Frontend (Vanilla) JS is the normal type you'll find in `<script>` tags. Node.js is a backend form of JS, and can be paired with Express.js to make a fullstack application. JS frameworks like React, EmberJS, AngularJS, Svelte, amongst other things. It's a good choice to start with.
3. HTML. A debate if it's a real programming language. As mentioned in [a previous post](/blog/discussion/2025/03/01/HTML-isn't-a-programming-language-or-is-it), HTML has the qualities of a programming language, but at the same time lacks crucial qualities. However, it remains as one of the languages that beginners learn. If you're looking into web development, you *have* to check HTML out.

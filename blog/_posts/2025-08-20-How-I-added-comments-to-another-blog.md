## Introduction
So, I haven‚Äôt been posting much recently, but I‚Äôm back with a new one ‚Äì how I added blog comments on an [AstroJS](https://astro.build/) blog I run.
I‚Äôve always thought ‚Äì how can I get readers to interact, to ask questions and get responses? Well, I‚Äôve done research into the different softwares that can implement comments, and I‚Äôll also tell you why I opted to make my own from scratch, instead of using an existing one.

## Existing software ‚Äì why they just don‚Äôt make the cut
There are *many* commenting softwares out there. Widgets, scripts, embeds, etc. But they wouldn‚Äôt be too bad, if not for the following reasons:

### A logo and a paywall
Sadly, many commenting widgets out there have logos at the bottom. And the ‚Äúbest‚Äù part? Removing them is locked behind some sort of paid membership, for example things like Elfsight.

### Design inconsistency
My blog did not match a lot of tools and software that gave comments. The difference in style was quite jarring, and didn‚Äôt really match the look of the blog, either.

### Third-party software and their trackers
I really don‚Äôt like to use 3rd-party software that tracks users‚Äô data, like location, IP address, and other PII that most people wouldn‚Äôt want flying about. I made it a point not to use the very popular Disqus, as I‚Äôm also big on open-source.

### Difficult to set up
My blog is running on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Some comment systems like Schnack or Remark42 needed VPSs themselves, some even running in Docker containers ‚Äì something [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) doesn‚Äôt really provide. And I didn‚Äôt want to spend any money on this. And another thing ‚Äì some have used [Staticman](https://staticman.net/) and had some success with it, but to me, it felt too complicated.

### So?
So, well, yes -  creating a comments system with something already out there proved to be harder than I thought. I saw Rachel Smith‚Äôs [blog post](https://rachsmith.com/static-blog-comments/) (the mouse trail is pretty cool) on how she added comments to her own Astro blog, but she used Netlify forms, something I didn‚Äôt have because I was using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (though I could have used Netlify, but I was lazy). Therefore, I gritted my teeth and got to work.

## The self-made comments system
I used a relatively simple Python app. Originally in full HTML and embedded via an Iframe, I wished to add authentication. To cut a (very) long story short, that didn‚Äôt work out. In the end, I used a Flask web app behind Gunicorn, deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

The app handled POST requests to add comments, and GET requests every 5 seconds by the host to update the comments list [^1]. This way, all I needed now was some vanilla JS and a form.

Well, not so simple. I needed a way to store the names of posters, so I used a text box that could not be edited by the user if they had posted before, which I called being 'signed in'. There is a link to 'sign out', so to speak ‚Äì it clears the username from `localStorage` and the textbox is now editable.

I used Flask-SQLAlchemy to structure the database model, and used a cloud database to store it. Originally using CockroachDB Cloud, I switched to Neon when my free trial was over (which I didn‚Äôt even know was possible). This went fairly smoothly, and now the database can be accessed from pretty much anywhere.

For the JS logic that handled the form submission, I obfuscated the whole file. Some "power users" could obviously realise I was using `readonly` on the name input, and I wasn‚Äôt taking my chances. The blog isn't programming-related, but you never know.

### Database model
My `models.py` file was not advanced, just a barebones structure of a comment:
```python
class Comment(db.Model):
  __tablename__ = "comments"

  comment_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
  comment_poster = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)
  comment_content = db.Column(db.String(300), nullable=False)
  belongs_to = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
  date_posted = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.now(pytz.timezone("************")))
```
I may add a `reply_to` feature in the future, where it corresponds to another comment's `comment_id`. My main issue with this is that I'm unsure how this will be displayed, like with nested replies?

### Routes
The `app.py` file is not overly complicated - I simply grab all the comments, reverse the list (so they're arranged by most recent) and send them. For posting, I just create a new comment based on the JSON passed and commit that. The `post_slug` argument here is the slug of the blog's post.
```python
@app.route('/<post_slug>', methods=['POST'])
def show_comments(post_slug):
  if request.is_json:
    name = request.get_json()['comments_poster']
    content = request.get_json()['comments_content']
    id = len(Comment.query.all()) + 1
    # Create new comment...
    # [...]
    db.session.add(newComment)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({'message': 'Comment added successfully'}), 201
  return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid request'}), 400

@app.route('/<post_slug>/comments', methods=['GET'])
def fetch_comments(post_slug):
  comments = list(reversed(Comment.query.filter_by(belongs_to=post_slug).all()))
  return jsonify([
    {
      'comment_poster': c.comment_poster,
      'comment_content': c.comment_content,
      'date_posted': c.date_posted.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') if c.date_posted else ''
    }
    for c in comments
  ])
```

### Authentication?
Ah yes. Authentication. Unfortunately, running something like Clerk wasn't possible of [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Worse luck, other authentication systems required me to switch my blog to [SSR](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/), which was quite incompatible with my blog, which uses the `static` mode [^2].

What did I do? A text box, paired with `localStorage` to store your username (and also making the input disabled, unless you sign out). Now when I say 'sign out', I mean nothing more than a link that clears the `localStorage` key. Of course, there are some glaring errors and it wouldn't be difficult for someone who knows HTML and JS to bypass this.

I didn't want to use things like Giscus (even though I do so for this blog), as it needed Github authentication, but my blog wasn't programming related. So that was out of the window.

## Conclusion
If you're into non-proprietary commenting systems that cost money or have annoying branding, I encourage you to make one yourself. This took longer than I expected (because of my trials and headaches with 3rd-party commenting systems), but the result really isn't too bad. This worked well on my Astro SPA. I might even consider using it for this blog ü§î.

But yeah, that's my experience with a bit of mishaps here and there. Happy coding!

[^1]: Courtesy of ChatGPT ‚Äì so much for trying not to use AI‚Ä¶ well, at least I don‚Äôt do vibe coding, but that‚Äôs a story for another day.
[^2]: If you really want to know the repercussions, all pages that display posts were broken, and all links redirected to `/posts/undefined`. It was a real headache fixing that, trust me. So I switched back to using `static`.

## Introduction
Well! This begins the start of a multi-part tutorial to create [Discourse](https://discourse.org) Theme Components. Why? I realised that although the [Discourse documentation](https://meta.discourse.org/c/documentation/developer-guides/56) contains *lots* of helpful guides, there's still a lot left that isn't written down, except in the Discourse codebase or in other TCs made.

## What you need
1. Github/any VCS that supports Git (e.g. GitLab)
2. You own development environment **OR** [Discourse Theme Creator (slightly unstable)](https://discourse.theme-creator.io)
3. JavaScript and HTML knowledge (a little is fine)
4. (RECOMMENDED) A [Discourse Meta](https://meta.discourse.org) account

My mind wanders... to the most banal, mundane and completely irrelevant thoughts. If you're the kind of person who wants to read people's absent-minded thoughts, this page is for you :)

## Light flickering
Has *anyone* noticed that when you see a lighbulb flickering from the corner of your eye, and you actually glance at the bulb to see what's wrong, it doesn't flicker!

Worse still, when you turn to the person next to you to tell them, and they look, it still doesn't flicker! So you'll have to put of with comments like "Ha ha, what a funny joke" (you know, those kind), and as you turn back...

IT FLICKERS AGAIN.

## [Discourse](https://discourse.org) commits have... everything
I've always wondered how some people magically link a commit or merged PR to a UX topic saying 'Oh, here's where the change was made' - just how do they get that so easily?

Today, I was on the verge of reporting a UX change where the emojis and size of welcome notices changed (as well as the ðŸŽ‰ emoji on welcome notices), but I decided to check the commit history just in case.

Boom. Right there:
<img width="388" height="172" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/993ebf38-ab96-4d5b-be27-7f3e5d371d4b" />

Bingo. Mental note: use date of realising the issue to pinpoint the approximate location of the commit. This is 98% accurate.

Another mental note: Open up a PR in the distant future to replace the ðŸ™‚ in welcome messages with an emoji instead of an icon.
